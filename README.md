# Getting Started

To get started, you need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
npm install
```

Finally, use these two commands to start the project:

1. To automatically bundle files from the `src` folder on changes:
```sh
npm run dev
```

2. If you need to run the web server for testing, in a separate terminal, run:
```sh
npm run web
```
